        <div class="q">
            What is the mode of communication used in braille?
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="a">
            The mode of communication used in braille is tactile, which means that it is based on touch rather than sight or sound. Braille uses a system of raised dots on a flat surface, typically paper, that can be felt with the fingertips. The raised dots represent letters, numbers, and other symbols, allowing individuals with visual impairments to read and write.

            What Braille is used in this system?
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="a">
            We use English Braille. English Braille is a writing system that uses a set of raised dots to represent the letters and numbers of the English alphabet. It is a tactile reading and writing system designed for people who are blind or visually impaired.
            The English Braille system consists of six dots arranged in a rectangular pattern, with each dot representing a different letter or symbol. There are also special symbols for punctuation, mathematical and scientific notation, and musical notation.
